            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>
               <seg rend="decorInit">I</seg>T is well ſeene, that all ſuch in this Land as ſeare not Gods Iudgements, are loath to be judged by your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nourable it is alſo very apparent, that were it not but for your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, there would bee no end of oppreſſion and wrong not any liuing in this Land, neither for Poore nor Rith; and that therefore, all the Kings louing and true hearted Subjects, both high and lowe, haue cauſe continually to pray for your Honours, next to our gracious Xing and his Royall Iſſue.</p>
            <p>Giue me (your poote Suppliant) leaue to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>clare the wrongs vnder which I haue a long time groaned; honing ſpent many yeares in the ſeruice of the <hi>Summer Ilands</hi> Company in much miſery
<pb facs="tcp:150412:2"/>eſpecially, in the two firſt yeares, wherein I was like to periſh through want of food, when the Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernor had not ſo much meale as would hold our one month, to giue to euery man one pound for a weeke, did (our of his care to ſaue ſome aliue) cull out all ſuch as were hartleſſe and lazie, and ſent them into the maine, to line vpon Berries, or to ſtatue, ſeeing there was no remedy: I then went to the Gouenor, and told him that it was too much cruelty to let them ſtarue in body and ſoule toge<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther, and therefore did deſire that I might goe with them. With much importunity he gaue me leaue to ſtay with them all the time of famine; in which time, I did pine a way to skinne and bone, and be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>came ſo weake, as they were glad to lead mee to ſome lowe rocke, on the ſide of an hill, where they ſet me downe firſt, and then ſat downe themſelues in rowes vpon the ground, to heare the word of God preached vnto them. Their forwardneſſe to heare Gods word, and the Gouernors loue in ſen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding continually to know how I did, did ſo heare and make glad my heart, as I made no reckning of the miſery and want that I liued in.</p>
            <p>When this Gouernors time was out, he came for <hi>England,</hi> and left the gouernment in the hands of ſixe men to gouern monthly.</p>
            <p>In the time of the miſ-rule of thoſe ſixe Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors, three of them went out in a little Pinace (to ſeeke for ſome relieſe) with a promiſe from the other three to admit of no Gouernor ſent from <hi>England,</hi> vntill ſixe month after there arriuall: not long after their departure, one of the other three (named <hi>Iohn
<pb facs="tcp:150412:2"/>Mansfield</hi>) became ſole Gouernor, and for the ſtrengthening of himſelfe againſt the Gouernor that was expected from <hi>England,</hi> did drawe a large Pe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tition as though the People had drawn it to entreat him to keepe the Gouernment in his owne hand; they promiſing to maintaine him againſt the Gol<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernor that was expected from <hi>England</hi> to which Petition, he and one <hi>Iohn Parker,</hi> a Black-Smith, drew the people euery where to ſubſcribe. Aſſoon as I heard thereof, I followed after from Tribe to Tribe preaching, and in my Sermons ſhewing the vnlawfulneſſe and euill that was like to come of the rebellion intended, and ſo drew the people euery where to renounice the ſaid Petition.</p>
            <p>The Vſurper hearing that the people had renoun<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ced the Petition, and that I was comming to the Towne, did raiſe the whole Towne vp in armes, to apprehend me and one Mr. <hi>Foſſeth,</hi> that kept me company; the ſaid Mr. <hi>Foſſeth</hi> being apprehended; they hung him vp on the Wharſe by the hands and feere, where he hung is grieuous paine, no man da<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ring to relieue him; but the women, who brought ſtones in their aprons, and thruſt them vnder his body, to heare vp the weight of it. After they had ſo hung him vp, <hi>Parker</hi> the Black-Smith, came and with a Crowe of yron brake open my Chamber doore, and drag'd me out to his owne houſe, where he kept me priſoner, till a tumultuous aſſembly was called, by the name of an Aſſizes, and then brought me to the Barre, where I was arraigned and condemned for a contemner of authority: The ſentence pronounced againſt me, was, that I ſhould
<pb facs="tcp:150412:3"/>be depriued of my miniſt<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>y; and confined to a little ſtand; where I ſhould be kept from comming to the people.</p>
            <p>This ſentence did ſo offend the people, as they would by no meanes yeeld to the execution of it; but told him, that they were ſtarued enough in their bodies, and that he had no reaſon to ſtarue them in their ſoules, by depriuing them of my mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſtery. By which oppoſition, I had reſt vntill the arriuall of a new Gouernor, one Captaine <hi>Tucker.</hi> Aſſoone as the Vſurper heard that a ſhippe was come into the Harbour with a new Gouernor, and what the new Gouernor had ſpoken to me, to preach at the reading of his Commiſſion; he the ſaid Vſur<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>per, caned the towne people together, and told them, that if they would ſtand to him like then, he would ſticke to them, ſo long as he had a droppe of blood in his heart; they promiſing that they would; he charged them to be vp in armes the next day betimes, and told them, he would not haue me to preach, but Mr. <hi>Keath</hi>: Mr. <hi>Keath</hi> was no Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſter, but a poore Schollet, that cunningly had got himſelfe ſent ouer for a Miniſter) who to further the rebellion intended, had buz'd into the peoples eares, that it was lawfull to reſiſt the Gouernor that was expected from <hi>England;</hi> and for prooſe thereof, did alleadge the example of the <hi>Iſraelites,</hi> their put<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ting downe of <hi>Rehoboam,</hi> and ſetting vp of <hi>Ioreboam</hi> in his ſteed. And to ſtirre vp the Vſurper to ſhed the blood of ſuch as ſhould dare to oppoſe him, he did alleadge the example of <hi>Athaliah,</hi> who to vſurpe the Gouernment, did murther all the
<pb facs="tcp:150412:3"/>King<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>de. Alſo be (the Vſurper) cold the people, that preſently after the Sermon, he would make a ſhort ſpeech to the Gouernor, and that he would haue them (aſſoone as he had left ſpeaking) to crye a <hi>Mansfield,</hi> a <hi>Mansfield,</hi> and then ſhew them<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſelues men.</p>
            <p>The next meaning, as I was ſtudying for my Sermon, and looking out at a windowe, I ſaw the people vp in armes, and heard one of them ſwears that he would ſheath his ſword in the new Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors guts: Whereupon I made haft out of my Chamber, and finding she Ship-boate ready to goe off did enter in, to goe to the new Gouernor, to ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint him with what was intended; the new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernor being then on ſhip-boord: I was no ſooner in the Boace, but certaine Muſcateres were ſent in haſt, by the Vſurper to ſhoote at me, vnleſſe I would come out: Whereupon, the Marriners fearing they would ſhoote, and kill ſome of them inſtead of me, did ſet me on ſhore againe.</p>
            <p>The Vſurper ſeeing me about to land, came with a ruſty browne Bill on his backe, as though hee meant to knocke me in the head; telling the people, that they had all of them cauſe, to curſe the time that euer they ſaw my face; which did put me in ſome ſeare, that either he or they would doe mee ſome miſchiefe; therefore I made haſt away, and lockt my ſelfe in my Chamber.</p>
            <p>About three or ſoure houres after, the new Gouernor came, and was ſuffered quietly to goe to the Church; where, aſſoone as Mr. <hi>Keath</hi> had made an end of his Sermon, the Vſurper made a
<pb facs="tcp:150412:4"/>ſhort ſpeech vnto him, and did no ſooner make an end of ſpeaking, but Mr. <hi>Keath</hi> (according as the Vſurper had giuen order) was the firſt man, that cried <hi>a Mansfield, a Mansfield;</hi> and ſo was like to ſet vs together by the eares, to cut one anothers throat, euen in the Church; had not the new Go<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uernor with ſpeed cauſed his Commiſſion to be read; the reading whereof, did ſo daunt the Vſurper, as he came downe and gaue place vnto him.</p>
            <p>Thus, I haue in part deliuered vnto your Ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nours, the ſturre (that <hi>Sathan</hi> in his inſtruments) did make in the time of the miſ-rule of the ſixe Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors; in hope thereby to bring ruine vpon that poore new planted Vineyard of the Lord Ieſus.</p>
            <p>What he was not able to accompliſh then, he was like to effect in the new Gouernors time; who was a fit inſtrument for him to ſtirre vp the people to mutany, and ſo to ouerthrow the Plantation: For he was no ſooner eſtabliſhed in his place, but hee tooke from euery one of the firſt Planters, halfe an Acre of ground, that the Company had giuen to them and theirs, which was no ſmall diſcourage<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment vnto them; conſidering the extreame pains that they had taken, in much hunger and nakednes, without any wages, in making 11. Forts.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Richard Sanders,</hi> and honeſt poore man, who had builded vpon his halfe acre a conuenient dwel<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ling houſe, and had beſtowed coſt and labor vpon a Garden Plot, where diuerſe good hearbs and flowers did growe; and greeuing to haue all ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ken from him on the ſuddaine; before he was prouided of any other place, for himſelfe, his poore
<pb facs="tcp:150412:4"/>wife and children; did but aske if they might not complaine to the King to for asking of that que<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtion, Capt. <hi>Tucker</hi> did impriſon him, and put more Iron vpon him, then no was able to heare, wherein hear lay vpon the ground night and day in grieuous paine.</p>
            <p>One <hi>Paul Deane,</hi> being arraigned and condem<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ned, for ſtealing a peece of cheeſe, pleaded the be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nefit of his cleargy (according to the lawes of <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi>) was rigorouſly denied, and ſo hang'd.</p>
            <p>The poore man that was put in Irons for asking if they might not complaine to the King (ſeeing how like a Tyrant Capt. <hi>Tucker</hi> behaued himſelf, in cudgelling the poore people, and in arraigning and condemning for ſmall matters, and cenſuring ſuch to romaine perpetuall ſlaues vnto the cullony) he and foure more, to free themſelues from, his ti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rannie, did deſperately leaue the Ilands and came for <hi>England,</hi> in a little Boate of two or three tunnes, or thereabout.</p>
            <p>The feare of his tyranny did reclaime diuerſe of the lazy crue, ſo as they became painfull labourers, for which he was much commended.</p>
            <p>The wrongs that he did me (your poore Sup<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pliant) were like to tempt me aboue my ſtrength: as firſt, he tooke my ſeruant from me, and ſo con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained me to liue comfortleſſe alone; and to goe vp and downe the Iland, ſeeking for fire-wood, and to bring it home on my backe, and then to goe from houſe to houſe for fire, and to goe with my Pitcher through the towne, to the Pumpe for wa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter; and to doe other baſe and ſeruill offices, very
<pb facs="tcp:150412:5"/>vnbeſeeming a Miniſter of Gods word. Alſo he tooke from me a peece of blacke ſtuffe, which St. <hi>Thomas Smith</hi> had cauſed to be bought for me. I being then in great want of cloathing, and ſo poore, as I was conſtrained to goe almoſt three yeares in one olde ſtrawe Hatte; and almoſt two yeares in one olde paire of cobled Shooes, uriuen full of nailes.</p>
            <p>Alſo, he tooke from me three acres of chaiſe ground for Tobacco, and two men that the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany had giuen me.</p>
            <p>Alſo, he did interrupt me in my Sermon, telling me, that I was out of my text, and when the Ser<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mon was ended, he did threaten to clap my neck and heeles together.</p>
            <p>The matter that did offend him, was this: I ſeeing (to my griefe) how in his two laſt yeares, he game ouer all care of the Plantation, to build and plane for himſelfe; and did exhauſt the ſtore, to build a ſtately houſe of Cedar for himſelf, Gods houſe all that while, being but a thacht Houell, which was kept ſo badly, as when it rained, there was almoſt no place where the people could ſit drie: I tooke occaſion on a day in my Sermon to ſhew how the wrath of God came on the <hi>Iſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raelites,</hi> for the like neglect of Gods houſe: Whereupon, he ſtood vp, and with a loud voyce, told me that I was out of my text, and to the euill example of the people, went out of the Church in agreat rage; and aſſoone as he ſaw me come out, came to me, and told me, that he would clappe my neck and heeles together: After that time, he
<pb facs="tcp:150412:5"/>he became an enemy vnto Religion, ſo as he con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſtrained me to giue ouer the Thurſday Lecture be<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cauſe the people could not come to heare me, hee did ſo employ them about his owne buſineſſe; he ſpared not the Sabboth day, but ſent the people a<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>broad, ſo as I was much diſcouraged from prea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ching in the after noones.</p>
            <p>In the time of his Gouernment God did bring a great Iudgement vpon the Ilands,<note place="margin">There are almoſt a 100 little Ilands, the biggeſt is but 18. miles long and almoſt two miles broad.</note> in that he cauſed Rats to abound, ſo as no Hand was free but were all like ſo many Conney-warrens of Rattes.</p>
            <p>The Rattes were a grieuous plague vnto the People, both within doors and without; Within, they deuoured all prouiſion of food, cloathes, and ſhooes: Without, they deuoured the Come, by ſcraping it out of the ground when it was new ſet; the graines that were thruſt in ſo deepe as they could not ſcrape vp, they deuoured in the blade, aſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſoone as it appeared aboue ground: Where ſome eſcaped them in the blade, they deuoured in the eare. They deuoured all other fruit of the earth, which ſerued for foode; and did kill and deuoure almoſt all the young Birds, and Chickens, &amp; ſuckt, their egges. I am not able to expreſſe the ſeare that was in the people, that they ſhould be ſtarued, when they ſaw that nothing that ſerued for foode, could be kept from the Rattes.</p>
            <p>The people did ſpend their whole time, night, and day, in keeping the Rattes vnder, by hunting them with dogges; ſetting of traps, and poiſon; &amp; burning the Ilands twice ouer, whereby much tim<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ber
<pb facs="tcp:150412:6"/>and fire-wood was conſumed.</p>
            <p>Then, euen then, when they endeuoured by all meanes to deſtroy the Rattes, they encreaſed the more; till God in mercy, hearing our praiers, did take them away on the ſuddaine, in three or ſoure daies, ſo as no man could tell how.</p>
            <p>Aſſoone as the Rattes were gone, the people with glad hearts did betake themſelues to plant Come, and by the bleſſing of God, had a plentifull harueſt: Whereupon Capt. <hi>Tucker</hi> being minded to come for <hi>England,</hi> cauſed euery man to bring a certaine quantity of corne into the Forts, to be kept there in ſtore, and handled the matter ſo (after he was come ouer) as he drew all the company to beleeue, that by meanes of his induſtry and care, the Ilands were ſo well furniſhed with corne, and the Ratts deſtroyed: Wherevpon, to require his care, they did beſtowe vpon him, the ſtately houſe that he had built, and three ſhares of the beſt land in all the Ilands.</p>
            <p>At his comming away, he left the Gouernment in the hands of one Captaine <hi>Kendall;</hi> who through pouerty, was conſtrained to take out of the Forts, the corne that Capt. <hi>Tucker</hi> and cauſed to bee brought in.</p>
            <p>After Capt. <hi>Kendall,</hi> ſucceded Capt. <hi>Nathaniel Butler,</hi> a man well qualified euery way for ſuch employment.</p>
            <p>He no ſooner ſaw how God had done his part, to make thoſe Ilands ſtrong, and ſafe from all for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>raine inuaſion, by fortifying them round about with fearefull rockes and ſhoules, ſo as there is no com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ming
<pb facs="tcp:150412:6"/>neare with ſhippes to inuade them, but in two narowe and durious channels, which doe lead into two goodly and large Harbours; and how the firſt Planters in Capt. <hi>Mores</hi> time, had done them beſt endeauours in the matter, of artificiall for<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tifications. as,</p>
            <p>On the channell that leadeth into the weſt har<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>bour, they had builded a ſtrong Fort, and a Caſtle, which they called the Kings Caſtle, where they had mounted 18. great Pieces, on carriages ſent from <hi>England;</hi> which through the negligence of ſuc<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ceeding Gouernors, were gone to decay. Capt. <hi>Butler</hi> tooke ſmall reſt, till he had repaired ſuch as could be repaired, and made new cariages of ce<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>dar for the reſt: ſo now thoſe 18. great Peices are very ſeruiceably mounted; ſo alſo are all the o<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther great Peices in the reſt of the Forts. As, not farre from that channell, towards the ſouth, is a Fort built by the firſt Planters in Capt. <hi>Mores</hi> time, called Charies Fort, where are two great Peices.</p>
            <p>On the North ſide of the Channell Capt. <hi>Butler</hi> bath built a ſtrong Fort to ſlanker the Kings Caſtie, which he called Southampton Fort, where are fiue great Peices, ſeruiceablely mounted by Cap. <hi>Butler</hi> on carriages of cedar: Which Fort doth make a great ſhowe to the ſea, as though it were a Caſtle.</p>
            <p>To the Northward of that Fort, the firſt Planters in <hi>Capt. Mores</hi> time, built a Fort, which they called Pembrooke Fort, where are two great Peices.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:150412:7"/>
            <p> The other Channell that leadeth into the Faſt Harbour, commonly called the Towne Harbour hath on the one ſide, towards the North, a Fort built by the firſt Planters in <hi>Capt. Mores</hi> time; called Rogers Fort, where are 7. great Pieces.</p>
            <p>On the other ſide, towards the South, is a Fort called Smiths Fort, built by the firſt Planters in <hi>Capt. Mores</hi> time, where are 5, great Peices.</p>
            <p>Not farre from that Channell, towards the north, is a Fort called Peniſtons Fort, built by the firſt planters in <hi>Capt. Mores</hi> time, where is one great Piece.</p>
            <p>A little from that Fort, is a Fort built by the firſt Planters in <hi>Capt. Mores</hi> time, called Sands Fort, where are 2. great Pieces.</p>
            <p>On a Hill neare the Harbour, is a Fort built by the firſt Planters in <hi>Capt. Mores</hi> time, called Warwicke Fort, where are 3. great Pieces to com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mand the Harbour.</p>
            <p>On a Hill neare the Towne was a high Mount, (built by the firſt Planters in <hi>Capt. Mores</hi> time) blowne downe with a terrible guſt of winde, &amp; is now built vp againe higher and ſtronger, by <hi>Capt. Butler:</hi> where is alſo one great piece, mounted by <hi>Capt. Butler</hi> to gine warning.</p>
            <p>In the Towne, vpon the Wharfe are 7. great Pieces, mounted by <hi>Capt. Butler,</hi> to command the Harbour; which great Pieces he recouered out of certaine Wrackes.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Captaine Butler</hi> hath built in the Towne a faire towne Hall of ſtone, and a faire ſtrong Priſon of cedar.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:150412:7"/>
            <p> In the Maine he hath built throe faire long Bridges of cedar, like Kingſton Bridge.</p>
            <p>In his time, the Kings I awes were eſtabliſhed in the Ilands, and the Aſſites kept orderly, as they are in <hi>England,</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Before his time, ever ſince <hi>Capt. Mores</hi> time, the Gouernors will went for lawe, and ſome of the Kings Subiects were hanged contrary to the Kings law, and ſome condemned and cenſured to per<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>petuall ſlauery.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Captaine Butler</hi> did ordaine ſort euery Tribe a Iuſtice of the Peace, a Conſtable, Chu<gap reason="illegible: blotted" extent="1+ letters">

            <p>Notwithſtanding, the great care that he had to ſuppreſſe ſince, it did abound euery day more and more, through the want of Gods Word, the Ilands being peſtered with leud Perſons, taken vp out of the S<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>es, out of Newgate and Bridewell.</p>
            <p>In his time I came to <hi>England,</hi> to ſeed I could perſwade ſome Miniſters to goe ouer, and to de<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>quaint the Company with the weake eſtate of the Ilands, and gr<gap reason="illegible: faint" extent="1+ letters">
                  <desc>•…</desc>
               </gap>uances of the people, which were ready to mutany.</p>
            <p>When I came into the <hi>Barmude</hi> Court to preſent the grieuances of the People, and weake eſtate of the Ilands, St. <hi>Edwas Sand;</hi> (misinforthed by <hi>Capt. Tucker</hi>) did ſtand vp in the face of the Court, to accuſe me of many ſoule crimes; ſaying vnto me, Mr. <hi>Lewes,</hi> you doe vſe in your Sermons to ſpeake againſt the Church of <hi>England,</hi> to raile vpon
<pb facs="tcp:150412:8"/>Biſhops, and to ſay that the Booke of Common Praier is but in dide Wiſes tale; and you will not Baptize Children, vnleſſe their Parents doe firſt make confeſſion of their Faith.</p>
            <p>To his firſt accuſation, I anſwered; that the Church of <hi>England</hi> was my Mother, and that al the knowledge, all the faith and hope of ſaluation that I haue, I had it in the Church of <hi>England,</hi> which I take to be the true Church of God; and that therefore, my tongue ſhall be cut out of my mouth, before it ſhall ſpeake againſt the Church of <hi>En<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>gland,</hi> as ſome doe:</p>
            <p>To his ſecond, concerning tailing vpon Bi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſhops, I tolde him, that it were too much peeuiſh<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>neſſe for me, to meddle with the Biſhops there, where they could not meddle with me: The truth is, that preaching vpon the ſuffering of our Sauiour Chriſt, I ſhewed how the high Prieſts, were the greateſt enemies that our Sauſour had: and from them I gathered, that the grace of God and lear<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ning dee not alway goe together; and for proofe of my doctrine, I ſhewed how the Romiſh Lord Biſhops are the greateſt ſupplanters of Chriſtian Religion, and ſhedders of Chriſtian blood; and did nominate bloody <hi>Bonner,</hi> Biſhop of <hi>London,</hi> and <hi>Gardner</hi> Biſhop of <hi>Wincheſter:</hi> Not ſpeaking a word of the reuerend Fathers, the Biſhops of the Church of <hi>England,</hi> as it now ſtands, whom I ho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour from my heart, for the good that I haue and dayly doe receaue out of their godly and learned Works.</p>
            <p>To his third accuſation, concerning the Booke
<pb facs="tcp:150412:8"/>of Common Praier: I anſwered, that I was ſo farre, from ſpeaking, as I neuer had, and hoped neuer ſhould haue a thought in my heart, tending to that way: wherevpon, Sr. <hi>Edwin</hi> did produce mine Enemie <hi>Capt. Tucker,</hi> for his Informer.</p>
            <p>
               <hi>Capt. Tucker</hi> did produce <hi>Capt. Kendall.,</hi> who teſtified, that he had heard me ſay that the Booke of Common Praier was good for olde men and wo<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wen to read at home, when they were not able to goe to Church.</p>
            <p>The Court taking notice how they differed in their teſtimony, ſome ſaid, <hi>Make how theſe men cannot agree in their teſtimonies, faine they would doe the poore man ſome harme, but they haue not agreed vpon the matter.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>
               <hi>Captaine Kendall</hi> was one of the three Gouer<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nors that promiſed to admit of no Gouernor ſent from <hi>England,</hi> he became mine enemy becauſe I had acquainted the Company with the wrongs that he had done the Ilands in the time of his Gouern<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ment, in taking the corne out of the Forts, and diſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>furniſhing the Ilands of certaine murthering Pieces, and other neceſſaries, which he ſould to a Pirat. I did acquaint the Company with nothing but what <hi>Capt. Butler</hi> (then Gouernor) did aduiſe me, and what I was bound by mine oath to declare, as I was one of the Priuie Counſell in the <hi>Summer Ilands.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>To his fourth accuſation, concerning the Bap<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tiſing of children, I anſwered, that many poore boyes and girles, (taken vp, out of the ſtreetes,
<pb facs="tcp:150412:9"/>out of New gate and Bride well and the Hoſpitals) were ſent to the Sommers Ilands, where they were brought vp in ignorance like Heathen, ſo as, when they became men and women, and were married, and had children, they were not able to bring vp their children in the Chriſtian Faith: therefore, to bring ſuch to haue ſome care of themſelues and of their children, I gaue out, that I would not baptiſe their children, vnleſſe the parents were able to yeeld ſome reckoning of their Faith, or at leaſt, rehearſe the Articles without booke; and to encourage them thereunto, I drewe ſome of the better ſort, (for example ſake) to rehearſe the Articles, before their children were baptiſed.</p>
            <p>After I had thus anſwered to his accuſations, I deſired the Court not to paſſe ouer ſleightly; the things whereof I was accuſed but, take ſome paines to examine and finde out the truth: them, Sin <hi>Edwin</hi> (as though hee had bene ſatisfied) did ſtand vp, ſaying vnto me, <hi>Well, well;</hi> Maſter Lewes, <hi>it is enough for you, that we knowe you to be an honeſt man, and that you haue done much good in the Plantation; as for theſe things, let them dye, ſtirre in them as further.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Though Sir <hi>Edwin</hi> made a ſhowe as though her were ſatisfied, and to haue a good opinion of nee yet, ſuch of the Company as are couete ouſly min<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ded, and do aime altogether at their own end were ſo againſt me, as they denyed to giue any thing to wards my charges in croſſing the ſeas in lying ſick
<pb facs="tcp:150412:9"/>&amp; weake at Falmouth, and in trauelling from thence to London by land, bring eleauen ſoore miles, with horſe and guide, not able ſome daye to trauell about tenmyles; yea they were ſo againſt me as they refuſed to relecue me with my wages, and ſo conſtrained me, (for the bearing of my charges backe againe to the Sommer Ilands) to take from my poore wife all that I could, and to leaue her in great want, which was no ſmall griefe vnto me.</p>
            <p>Within few monthes after my arriuall, a newe Gouernour, (one Captaine <hi>Bernard</hi>) was ſent to ſucceede Captaine <hi>Butler,</hi> and with him foure Mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>niſters.</p>
            <p>One of the Miniſters named Maſter <hi>Wright,</hi> was no ſooner landed, but went about the Ilands in<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>uaighing againſt me, almoſt three weekes before I could finde him out: at length, when I came where he was he tould me that he tooke me to be a diſho<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nour to the, Miniſtery and a ſhame to all Miniſters, and that Sir <hi>Edwin Sands</hi> had tould him that I was a man not fit to liue in a Common-wealth: which opprobrious ſpeeches, I tooke patiently, becauſe the ſtanders by did cleare me of thoſe things where<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>of he had accuſed me; ſo as he ſeemed to be ſatis<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fied, and went about the Ilands, ſpeaking well of me where he had ſpoken euill, and dyed within ſixe or ſeauen dayes after.</p>
            <p>The new Gouernour then lying vpon his death bed, and hearing that I did grieue and pine away, becauſe he and the Miniſters had an euill opinion of
<pb facs="tcp:150412:10"/>me, did ſend an honeſt man, one <hi>Willam More</hi> to comfort me, willing him to tell me, that he found no truth in the reports that were made vnto him of me by ſome of the Company, and that if I would ſtay in the Ilands, I ſhould finde his loue: within foure dayes after this, It pleaſed God that he alſo dyed.</p>
            <p>After the death of the Gouenour, diuers of the diſhoneſt and vnruly ſort, (taking notice how the Miniſters and the new Officers that were ſent ouer with the new Gouernour, had an euil opinion of me) did ſo wrong and inſult ouer me, as was like to breake my heart, and hauing receaued a lamen<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mentable letter from my wife, ſignifying that the Company did refuſe to pay the mony that I did allow her, out of my wages, and that ſhe was in great want, I reſolued to come for England.</p>
            <p>At my returne backe againe? Sir <hi>Edwin Sands</hi> and Deputie <hi>Ferrar</hi> who then were the chiefe ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nagers of the affaires of the Sommer Ilands, had got a new matter againſt me, which being openly reade in the Court behind my backe, did confirme diuerſe of the Aduenturers in the euill opinion that they had of me their new matter was, certaine falſe notes, collected out of a Sermon, that I made before diuers that were inclined to mutiny, by meanes of which falſe notes, the hearts of ſuch as with their multiplicitie of voyces beare moſt ſway, are ſo ſet againſt me, as I am like to loſe the greateſt part of my wages to my vtter vndoing.</p>
            <pb facs="tcp:150412:10"/>
            <p> Being aduiſed by my friends to petition his Ma<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jeſties Commiſſioners for Virginea and Sommers Ilands, my petition was ſent by them to the Com<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pany for an anſwer; whereupon Maſter <hi>Nicholas Ferrar,</hi> then Deputie, came to the Commiſſioners and tould them, that there was nothing due vn<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to me, and that if there were, he would pay euery penny himſelfe.</p>
            <p>Sir <hi>Edwin</hi> alone, did take vpon him to anſwer my Petition in writing, and did ſo wrong me, as one of the Commiſsioners tould me, that there was ſuch matters againſt me, as they muſt turne me to a higher authority: whereupon I did petition your Honours aboue twelue monthes ſince, and had an order to enioyne the Company to giue preſent ſa<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tisfaction of what was due: whereupon Maſter <hi>Iohn Ferrar</hi> late Deputie came into the Court and openly in the face of the Court did affirme, that there was nothing due vnto me, vnto whoſe teſti<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>mony, the multitude (who with their multiplicity of voyces doe beare all the ſway) haue giuen ſuch credit, as I haue no hope to recouer my wages.</p>
            <p>The Gouernour Sir <hi>Thomas Smith,</hi> and others that are honourable and Chriſtianly minded, though they be willing, yet are not able to helpe me, becauſe of the multiplicity of voyces that are againſt me: therefore I am conſtrained to appeare from the multiplicity of voyces to your Honours for Iuſtice.</p>

            <p>My Aduerſaries doe ſay, that the Company, ſince my comming for <hi>England,</hi> haue paid their Moitye, and that I was to receaue the other in the Ilands; and that therefore the Company are not to pay it.</p>
            <p>To them I anſwere, that I neuer could haue foure men to manage the Gleabe-land accor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ding to the order; and therefore, the people did not contribute there, but haue paid their Moitye in money heare, according to the impoſition layed on their Tobacco.</p>
            <p>For the yeare 1620. wherein (finding my ſelfe to faint vnder the intollerable butthen with I was conſtrained to vndergoe) I came to <hi>England,</hi> to ſee if I could perſwade ſome Miniſters to goe ouer, and alſo to acquaint the Company with the grieuances of the people, which were ready to mutany: And alſo to acquaint them with the weake eſtate of the Ilands, moſt needfull to bee lookt into in time: I require a 100. pounds, ac<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>cording
<pb facs="tcp:150412:13"/>to their law. Becauſe it was neuer heard, that a Miniſter in <hi>England,</hi> comming to <hi>London</hi> about the Important affaires of the Common<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>wealth, had his liuing ſequeſtted from him for that time.</p>
            <p>For the yeare 1621. Wherein I did returne to the <hi>Summer Ilands,</hi> the Company then in their generall Letters did deſire the Gouernor to prouide for me, according to their orders; which he could not doe, becauſe the Tobacco Harueſt was paſt before their letters came; Therefore, I deſire that the 100 pounds due for that yeare may bee made good ſome other way the poor people there hauing paid their moity in money here, according to the im<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>poſition that was layed vpon their Tobacco.</p>
            <p>For the yeare 1622. I am ſatisfied becauſe the Gouernor (according to the order) did leauie 600. weight of Tobacco, to make vp the Tobacco which was made that yeare on the gleabe land to the value of a 100. pounds ſtarling.</p>
            <p>For the yeares 1623. &amp; 1624. wherein the Company haue not as yet diſcharged me of my Cure, neither by order of Court, nor by warning, nor by any ſatisfaction; but haue kept me in ſuſ<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>pence, ſuing for my wages with much grieſe of heart, being much indepted, hauing no meanes to pay my depts, nor to relieue my ſelfe, my poore
<pb facs="tcp:150412:14"/>Wife and Family, but by borrowing and going on the ſoore, ſo as my deptes are increaſed: The leaſe of my houſe which coſt me 30. pounds, laied in pawne for 12. pounds, is forfeited: It is alſo forfeited to the Landlord for not paying the laſt quarters rent: a Bond of 60. pounds is forfeited for non paiment of 27. pounds. My poore aged wife whoſe heart is almoſt broke with grieuing, is mi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſerable weake and ſicke, I hauing not a penny to buy her a loaſe of bread but as I borrow or begge; For theſe two yeares that haue beene ſo grieuous and chargeable vnto me, I will thankfully accept of what your Honours ſhall think fit, either by way of ſalary, becauſe I am not as yet diſcharged of my Cure; or by way of dammage, in regard of my loſſes and hindrances.</p>
            <p>Concerning the agreement, which (as they ſay) was made at my returned to the <hi>Summer Ilands,</hi> viz. That if the Company would pay vnto my Wife 95. pounds, and giue me the tranſportation of two men, I would be therewith ſatisfied, and put the Company to no more charges: which agreement the Company did breake firſt, in refu<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſing to pay the ſaid 90. pounds to my wife, which hath brought her to ſuch want and griefe, as is like to coſt her her life, and therefore I am not bound to ſtand to it, conſidering they brake it firſt.</p>
